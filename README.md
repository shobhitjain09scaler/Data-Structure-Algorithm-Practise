# Data Structure and Algorithm
This is my practice set of data structure and algorithm from YouTube - Data Structures and Algorithms in Python - Full Course for Beginners (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkYVOmU3MgA&t=2363s)
I created this file while learing DSA. I used to watch the video and code everything simultaneously. I also add few notes and tips as comments for better understanding.
